    "Welcome to day 1 of the 5-Day Data Challenge! Today, we're going to be looking at how to deal with missing values. To get started, click the blue \"Fork Notebook\" button in the upper, right hand corner. This will create a private copy of this notebook that you can edit and play with. Once you're finished with the exercises, you can choose to make your notebook public to share with others. :)\n",

    "> **Your turn!** As we work through this notebook, you'll see some notebook cells (a block of either code or text) that has \"Your Turn!\" written in it. These are exercises for you to do to help cement your understanding of the concepts we're talking about. Once you've written the code to answer a specific question, you can run the code by clicking inside the cell (box with code in it) with the code you want to run and then hit CTRL + ENTER (CMD + ENTER on a Mac). You can also click in a cell and then click on the right \"play\" arrow to the left of the code. If you want to run all the code in your notebook, you can use the double, \"fast forward\" arrows at the bottom of the notebook editor.\n",

First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also let's you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n",

    "* [Handling Missing Values](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/handling-missing-values): In this notebook Dan shows you several approaches to imputing missing data using scikit-learn's imputer. \n",
    "* Look back at the `Zipcode` column in the `sf_permits` dataset, which has some missing values. How would you go about figuring out what the actual zipcode of each address should be? (You might try using another dataset. You can search for datasets about San Fransisco on the [Datasets listing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).) \n",

    "\\* no actual credit is given for completing the challenge, you just learn how to clean data real good :P"
